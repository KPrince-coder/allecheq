# AllECHEQ: A FOOD ALLERGEN DETECTION MOBILE APPLICATION
*by Atuah Theophilus Opoku & Kyeremeh Prince Kwabena*


## Introduction
This project is focused on developing an AI-powered mobile application, AlleCheq, designed to detect food allergens in products, specifically targeting children under 12 and middle to high school students. The application leverages machine learning, with a multi-label classification approach to identify potential allergens in food labels. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a curated dataset, the model is capable of recognizing and classifying allergens from images of food packaging.
The AlleCheq app aims to address the limitations of traditional allergen detection methods by providing a user-friendly, accurate, and accessible solution. This is particularly important for individuals with food allergies who need to make informed decisions about what they consume. The app includes features such as real-time allergen detection, emergency alerts, and educational content on food allergens, making it a comprehensive tool for enhancing food safety and awareness.
## Project Code
The project code, Google Colab can be found in the `project code` folder of this [repository](https://github.com/KPrince-coder/allecheq). The code details each step, from data collection to data preprocessing and model training to the integration of the machine learning model into the mobile application.

## Mobile App: AlleCheq

The trained AI model has been integrated into a mobile application named AlleCheq, built using Kotlin for both the frontend and backend. The app is designed for easy accessibility, allowing users to detect allergens by simply taking a picture of a food product's label.To use AlleCheq locally, clone our public (GitHub repository) (https://github.com/KPrince-coder/allecheq). Open the project in your preferred Kotlin IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.

Once the app is running:

Launch the AlleCheq app.
Use the camera feature to take a picture of a food product's label, or upload an image from your gallery.
The AI model will analyze the image and display whether the product contains any allergens.
You can also explore educational content about food allergies or use the emergency feature to send alerts in case of an allergic reaction.
AlleCheq is designed to provide quick, reliable results, empowering users to make safer food choices with confidence.
